# Personal website

This is a great starter project since you get to build something that will be useful beyond just learning.
Your personal website will be a good addition to your resume and depending on what you decide to do, can even showcase some of your coding skills and creativity.
Also, working on your personal website using a [version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) system like [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) will be a great way to familiarize yourself with a tool that is used at almost every company.
